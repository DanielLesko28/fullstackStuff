# fullstackStuff

This is Fullstack app using express.js on backend with MongoDB as a database and mongoose to make request to the database.
To make this app run, You have to create.env file and add URI to connect to your own database.

This is app where I' trying to show many different skills that I can do.
On the frontend the app is built using React. Also I'm using local storage for saving authenticated user and app also has couple of protected routes, to which You're not able to access untill You're signed in.

App is also using redux in some parts to try and work with global management tool. So far I'm not using Redux toolkit but plain redux in order to learn the core principles of redux. Later on I will think about adding also couple of pages with it.

For styling I'm using a mixture of CSS.
In some parts CSS preprocessors are used and in other parts I'm using third-party libraries more specifically Chakra UI where I can used prebuilt CSS components so the development process is much faster.
